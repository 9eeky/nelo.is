## Problem
**Default `:focus` behaviour is bad.**

Focus rings can be confusing for users with pointing devices (e.g. mouse, touch screen) because it implies a sense of persistence when showing up **right after a click or a touch event**.

Designers know this _intuitively_.

They then need to make the `:focus` state obvious enough for keyboard users but at the same time, keeping it unobtrusive for mouse users.

This usually involves a compromise. Some, even remove the default focusing behaviour entirely which is **terrible for accessibility**.

> Removing the `:focus` outline is like removing the wheelchair ramp from a school because it doesn‚Äôt fit in with the aesthetic.

<cite>David Gilbertson</cite>

## Solution
Ideally, the focus ring should only show up **when the user intends to use the keyboard**.

We need a better default browser behaviour. In cases like this, it's always a good idea to check if there are existing or upcoming browser specifications that solve our problem.

Luckily for us, there's one: **Introducing** `:focus-visible` üéâ.

### Spec
`:focus-visible` is the keyboard-only version of `:focus`. I honestly think it should be the new default and W3C quite agrees.

The [W3C proposal](https://drafts.csswg.org/selectors-4/#the-focus-visible-pseudo) mentions that `:focus-visible` should be preffered over `:focus` except on elements that expect a keyboard input (e.g. text field, contenteditable).

### Usage
At the time of writing, only Firefox [supports](https://caniuse.com/#search=focus-visible) `:focus-visible` natively. But the good news is that there's an excellent [polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) available for us. Here's a [demo](https://wicg.github.io/focus-visible/demo/) if you'd like to see it for yourself before we dive into the actual implementation details.

### Implementation
#### Installation
###### via NPM
```bash
npm install --save focus-visible
```
```js
require('focus-visible')
```

###### via UNPKG
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/focus-visible@latest/dist/focus-visible.min.js"></script>
```

#### Styling
The [polyfill](https://github.com/WICG/focus-visible) adds a `.focus-visible` class on elements that match the `:focus-visible` state, so styling is pretty straightforward.
```css
/* Remove outline for non-keyboard :focus */
*:focus:not(.focus-visible) {
  outline: none;
}

/* Optional: Customize .focus-visible */
.focus-visible {
	outline-color: skyblue;
}
```

#### ‚≠êÔ∏è Bonus tip: a better alternative to `outline`
```css
*:focus {
  outline: none;
}

/* box-shadow outlines rounded corners! */
.focus-visible {
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 2px skyblue;
}
```

##### Have a great time styling
Noticed how I used `:focus-visible` on this site's [homepage](/)? Hit me up on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nelonoel) if you find this useful! üòÅ
